ELFIO is a header-only C++ library intended for reading and generating
files in the ELF binary format. It is used as a standalone library - it is not
dependent on any other product or project. Adhering to ISO C++, it compiles on
a wide variety of architectures and compilers.

While written in C++, the library provides a C-language interface wrapper.

The full library documentation can be found in "ELFIO - Tutorial and User
Manual" at http://elfio.sourceforge.net/elfio.pdf.
