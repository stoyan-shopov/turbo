This program is a debugger frontend for the 'gdb' debugger.
This program also provides access to the blackmagic probe.

This is the text view where source code is displayed.
Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts in this source code view.

SPACE	- toggle breakpoint on the current line
<F2>	- toggle a bookmark on the current line
CTRL + LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - when over a string, attempt to navigate to the definition of that string as a symbol
ALT + LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - when over a string, search all known files for the occurrence of that string
ALT + LEFT ARROW - navigate back (if possible)
CTRL + ALT + v - open current file in the vim editor

When a connection to a target is established, and a debug session is active:

s	- single step to next statement
n	- step over to next statement
c	- continue target execution
CTRL + c - if the target is currently running, attempt to halt the target


Thank you for using this program! I hope you find it useful!
