Turbo - increase efficiency of using the gdb debugger

This is a minimalistic frontend to the gdb debugger.
The goal is to provide a good graphical interface to the gdb debugger, for the purpose of debugging C programs for ARM Cortex-M devices, with the help of the blackmagic probe.
It should also work for remote debugging with gdb in general

To build this software, you need Qt. To use it, you will also need a recent `arm-none-eabi-gdb` debugger

This is a work in progress, and is currently not stable.
This `Readme` file will be updated with build and usage instructions.
Please, if you are interested, before trying this software, wait a bit until this file is updated.

Thank you!
