Turbo

This is a minimalistic frontend to the gdb debugger.
The goal was to provide a good graphical interface to the gdb debugger, for the purpose of debugging C programs for ARM Cortex-M devices, with the help of the blackmagic probe

I do not have the most precious resource - time, to continue working on this
I still hope this will be of use to someone. If so, please submit issues, or contact me directly at 'stoyan.shopov@gmail.com'

To build this software, you need Qt. To use it, you will also need a recent `arm-none-eabi-gdb` debugger

Thank you, and take care!
